            <h3>Understanding your result</h3>
            <p>A value at or close to 0 indicates a low risk of bankruptcy. A value close to or at 1 indicates a high risk.</p>
            <h3>Where did this value come from?</h3>
            <p>This bankruptcy risk value was generated by a machine learning model based on a Random Forest Regression
                algorithm. The model was trained using a publicly available dataset obtained from 
                Kaggle.com (the dataset can be found 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction" target="_blank">here</a>).
            </p>
            <p>80 percent of the dataset was used to train the model. The remaining 20 percent was used to test accuracy.
                The machine learning model was able to achieve 95.28% accuracy on the test data, and it was only off by an
                average of 0.0472 from the actual bankruptcy value (which, in the test data, was either a 0 or a 1).
            </p>
            <h3>How do I interpret this value?</h3>
            <p>Due to the "black box" nature of machine learning models, this risk value is only meant to provide a 
                general idea of risk, rather than to quantify it specifically. Therefore, the following
                broad categories should be considered:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Low risk: 0.00 - 0.33</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Moderate risk: 0.33 - 0.66</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>High risk: 0.66 - 1.00</h4>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
